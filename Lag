Lage is super useful. You can use this to get the value of the cell immediately prior. Basically, if all of your values 
are in one column and you need to know the difference between them.

In practice, I've used this to find the difference in the length of times between purchases for customers.

Using dplyr 
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

df %<>%
  group_by(CustomerNumber) %>%
  mutate(diff = PurchasesDate - lag(PurchasesDate),
           diff_days = as.numeric(diff, units = 'days'))
           
If the DF is huge, you can break it up into several pieces.

df %<>%
  group_by(CustomerNumber) %>%
  mutate(lag = lag(PurchasesDate)
  
Then you can take the lag column and the DiffTime(y,x) function to get the difference between the two.
